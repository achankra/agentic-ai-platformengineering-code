# Alternative Slide Layouts Guide

## Overview
These alternative layouts maintain your purple/lavender color palette and Pearson branding while breaking up the visual monotony of your presentation. Mix these in with your existing slides for better visual flow.

---

## Layout 1: Numbered Progressive Steps
**Best for:** Sequential processes, workflows, or stages that build on each other

**Visual Design:**
- Three columns with numbered circles above each section
- Gradient purple shading (light to dark) across the three columns
- Content in rounded boxes with white text
- Creates visual flow from left to right

**When to use:**
- AI-Driven Remediation Patterns (Diagnostic → Corrective → Preventive)
- Pipeline stages
- Step-by-step processes
- Any content with 2-4 sequential phases

**Example from your deck:** Use for "AI-Driven Remediation Patterns" slide

## Layout 2: Side-by-Side Comparison with Divider
**Best for:** Before/after comparisons, traditional vs. enhanced approaches

**Visual Design:**
- Two equal-width boxes separated by a vertical divider with arrow
- Left box: white background (traditional/old)
- Right box: purple background (AI-enhanced/new)
- Visual arrow showing progression/evolution

**When to use:**
- Traditional CI/CD vs. Intelligent CI/CD
- Before/after scenarios
- Manual vs. automated processes
- Any "old way" vs "new way" content

**Example from your deck:** Use for "Automated Rollback Decisions" comparison slide

---

## Layout 3: 2x2 Grid
**Best for:** Multiple metrics, assessments, or evaluation criteria

**Visual Design:**
- Four equal quadrants in a grid
- Each box in gradient purple shades
- Clean, scannable layout
- Great for status dashboards

**When to use:**
- Quality gate evaluations (Test Coverage, Performance, Security, Complexity)
- Four key metrics or KPIs
- Capability matrices
- Status reports with multiple dimensions

**Example from your deck:** Use for "Release Readiness Evaluation" slide

---

## Layout 4: Horizontal Process Flow
**Best for:** User journeys, interaction patterns, or operational workflows

**Visual Design:**
- Four columns in a row
- Dark purple headers above lighter purple content boxes
- Arrows connecting the stages
- Shows clear progression through steps

**When to use:**
- Conversational operations interfaces (Ask → Explain → Request → Review)
- User interaction flows
- Decision trees
- Any 4-step horizontal process

**Example from your deck:** Use for "Conversational Operations Interfaces" slide

## Implementation Strategy

### Suggested Mix for Your Presentation:
1. **Keep your title slide** (current format works well)
2. Replace "AI-Driven Remediation Patterns" → **Layout 1** (Numbered Steps)
3. Replace "Automated Rollback Decisions" → **Layout 2** (Side-by-Side)
4. Replace "Release Readiness Evaluation" → **Layout 3** (2x2 Grid)
5. Replace "Conversational Operations Interfaces" → **Layout 4** (Horizontal Flow)
6. **Keep simpler slides** (Traditional CI/CD, Quality Gates Deep Dive, Exercise Steps) in your current format

This gives you variety without overwhelming the audience - roughly 40% alternative layouts, 60% original format.

## Tips for Using These Layouts
- **Don't overuse:** Mix these with your simpler slide formats
- **Content drives choice:** Pick the layout that best fits your content structure
- **Progressive complexity:** Use simpler layouts early, more complex ones mid-presentation
- **Visual breaks:** Use these layouts after 2-3 traditional slides to maintain engagement
